# LizziLight

LizziLight is a collection of shaders for the Unity engine that allow for a "cutout" lighting effect instead of the standard additive lighting.

## Before You Use LizziLight

If you'd like to use the shaders, please credit me in your project as Eva Jolene. I would also appreciate a donation if you like using it, but it's not required! You can donate here: https://www.paypal.me/evajolene
